As an introduction to the topic, let's take some examples

- ApeCoin
- Moonbirds
- MAYC
- Kaiju
- ThePlague

## Examples

### ApeCoin

ApeCoin lauch rewards the possession of select BAYC related tokens, with decreasing value per token generation, so 

```
BAYC > MAYC > KAYC
KAYC = x && (MAYC || BAYC)
```

And by staking you earn for time tokens are kept from the market, to influence supply to pressure price.

### Moonbirds

Also staking to remove from market, with no launch rewards, and high initial price of 2.5eth.

### MAYC 

MAYC launch sold 10k via dutch auction starting at 3eth, and distributed 10k serum NFTs, 1 for each BAYC NFT, and with random rarity

- 7500 m1
- 2492 m2
- 8 m3

serums can only be used once, any BAYC can get all types only once each.

Reward is for holding at snapshot and random.

# A new system

A reward system designed not to promote holding, shorting supply and pressuring price, instead, encourage engagent with the community and the brand, by incentivizing the sale of the NFTs. 

So a holder who owns 3, but has already owned 100 different ones before, is more rewarded than a holder who owns 3 and has owned that same one forever.

A holder who owns 1 and has already owned 20 different ones before is more rewarded than a holder that owns 5 but has only ever held those 5.

This encourages the community to interact and to connect to ensure they have the chance of holding as many different as possible through time.
