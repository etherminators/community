# Social Raid Protocol

Social Raids are a powerful tool for promotion which helps build the community and increase resources with distributed and low cost effort.

Etherminator holders and aspiring members should raid every post and tweet from the official @etherminators accounts, from the team members and from other peers on the community, and any other message talking about the project.

This type of engagement is an investment on everyone's bags, including yours.

## Raid Points

While Likes are cute, they are not really helpful as they do not help promote messages.
Instead raids should strive to rebroadcast messages and to add to the conversation, via retweets/reposts and comments.

- 3 points: Like, RT and comment
- 5 points: Like, Quote and comment
- 1 point for each comments on comments

## Shill Etiquette

- Only shill on comment if requested by the host tweet
- When shilling, like and RT the host tweet
- Always include a meme or an NFT image
- Tag other project members
- When tagged, respond in kind
