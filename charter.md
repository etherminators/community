# Etherminators Community Charter

## The Etherminators

The Etherminators began operations in late 2021 and launched the original collection in Jan 2022, using primarily twitter and discord as means for marketing and community outreach. Since then the collection has sold ~4.1k items of the 6969 total, to a total of ~1.6k wallets, with holdings varying between 1 and one hundred, and also notable holders like Fred Durst.

The Etherminators NFT holds a CryptoPunk derivative art, using the same size and style, but having its own model of rarities, which comprises 9 mimetics, 48 apes, 88 metalnoids, and 6824 humanoids.

The Etherminators brand and its mission (BECOME A SYMBOL OF THE FIGHT FOR THE OPEN METAVERSE), vision (TO INSPIRE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO FIGHT FOR A DECENTRALIZED, FREE AND OPEN DIGITAL FUTURE FOR EVERYONE.), and lore, provide a rich foundation from which to build a community focused on decentralized and open culture and technology. And the aesthetics from sci-fi and parody help greatly as well.

While this context also provides foundation for interesting products, The Etherminators envisions onboarding 50k members on the web3 space via the community, so we also believe that a purposeful community is needed.

## The Community

The Etherminators community is a virtual and offline community of people interested in one or more of the main objectives of the community.

### Objectives

The 3 main objectives of the community are Fitness, Open Source, Open Culture.

#### Support Fitness / Olympia

The Etherminators owe much to the work of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and that drives us to care for fitness. Not only that, for humans to be healthy and self reliant, should they stand a chance to survive a machine dominated future.


#### Support Open Source / Unionnet

The Etherminators believe that open source is the key for an open and egalitarian future. From the blockchain, to the art engines for NFTs and even everything before that, open source technology is what makes The Etherminators possible.

#### Support Open Culture / Meta

The Etherminators believe in open culture, in building from existing memes, like Terminator and Meta, and in having freedom to earn from your work.
